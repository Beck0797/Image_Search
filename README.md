# Image_Search
This is Android Image Search app that I made using kotlin and [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation) for images. For this, I used an MVVM architecture, Paging 3, Glide, Retrofit, Coroutines, the Navigation Component, View Binding, and Dagger Hilt. I want to say big thanks to [Florian Walther](https://codinginflow.com/) for great courses that helped me.
